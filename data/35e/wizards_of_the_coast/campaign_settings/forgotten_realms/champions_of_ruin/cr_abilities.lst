Feral Rage					KEY:Black Blood Cultist ~ Feral Rage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Features.Black Blood Cultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:Black Blood cultist class levels stack with barbarian levels for purposes of determining your rage ability. Thus, an 8th-level barbarian/4th-level Black Blood cultist can use greater rage four times per day, just as a 12th-level barbarian could. Black Blood cultists strengthen their fi ngers and toughen their nails with special training. As a result, when raging, you gain two claw attacks at your highest base attack bonus. Each claw deals 1d6 points of damage plus your Strength modifi er. You can use a one-handed weapon and a claw, but when doing so the claw counts as a secondary weapon (adding only half your Strength bonus to damage, and with a –5 modifi er on the attack roll). At 3rd level, you gain a bite attack when raging in addition to your two claw attacks. The claws are still your primary weapons and the bite is your secondary weapon. The bite deals 1d4 points of damage plus half your Strength modifi er. You can use a two-handed weapon with your bite as a secondary attack, or you can use a one-handed weapon with your claw and bite as secondary attacks. At 6th level and higher, whenever you hit with both of your claw attacks during a rage, you rend your opponent’s fl esh, automatically dealing double claw damage in addition to normal damage.
