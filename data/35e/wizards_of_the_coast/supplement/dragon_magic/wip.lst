AMULET OF FEARSOME MIGHT	TYPE:Amulet.Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.93
	SPROP:When worn, an amulet of fearsome might doubles the radius of the wearer's innate frightful presence (to a 60-foot radius per age category, in the case of dragons) and increases its save DC by 2. If the wearer does not have a frightful presence, the amulet does not bestow that ability. In addition, if the wearer casts any spells or spell-like abilities with the fear descriptor, the amulet increases their save DC by 2. This bonus does not stack with that from the Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus feats. This ability functions whether or not the wearer has an innate frightful presence. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate necromancy; CL 7th.

CLOAK OF MYSTERIOUS EMERGENCE	TYPE:Cape.Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.93
	SPROP:It takes a standard action to call forth the power of a cloak of mysterious emergence and step into its maw. Once the wearer arrives in his new location, he can't take any other actions until his next turn. Effect: Stepping through the dragon maw created by a cloak of mysterious emergence functions like a dimension door spell with a range of 120 feet. A cloak of mysterious emergence has three charges per day. However, the wearer can choose to expend all three charges to have the cloak teleport him and up to 50 pounds of items up to 120 miles away. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate conjuration; CL 9th.

DRAGONSLAYER CLAWS	TYPE:Glove.Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Negative Level|!PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood
	SPROP:Activating dragonslayer claws is a free action. The wearer can use the claws once per round, up to a maximum of three times per day. Before making an attack roll, the wearer must declare to which attack the extra damage will be applied. Effect: When the wearer makes a claw attack, dragonslayer claws deal an extra 1d6 points of damage. Against a creature of the dragon type or the dragonblood subtype, the claws instead deal an extra 3d6 points of damage and are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate transmutation; CL 8th.

RING OF DRACONIC ZEAL (LESSER)	TYPE:Ring.Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.94
	SPROP:Once per day, the wearer can invoke the power of the ring (a swift action). Effect: Immediately after activating the ring, the wearer can make one melee attack using his highest base attack bonus against each of three different enemies within reach (a full-round action). This effect applies only during the round in which the ring is activated. If the wearer activates the ring but can't take a full-round action during that round, the effect is wasted.

ROD OF DRAGON'S BLOOD	TYPE:Rod	SOURCEPAGE:p.94
Prerequisite: A lesser rod of dragon's blood
functions only for characters of the dragon
type or the dragonblood subtype, as well as for
any character with at least 1 level of sorcerer.
Activation: Activating a lesser rod of dragon's
blood requires the same action normally
required to cast the chosen spell (see Effect,
below). The rod can be activated three times
per day.
Effect: When activated, a lesser rod of dragon's
blood allows the wielder to recast any spell of
up to 2nd level that he cast in the previous
round. Doing this doesn't use another spell
slot. Only spells with a casting time of 1 standard
action or less can be recast using the lesser
rod of dragon's blood.
Wielders of the dragon type instead can reuse
any spell-like ability of up to 2nd level that
they used in the previous round. This doesn't
count against their normal daily limit for that
spell-like ability.
The rod also functions as a quarterstaff.
Variant: A greater rod of dragon's blood allows
the wielder to recast any spell of up to 4th level
he cast in the previous round, or to reuse any
spell-like ability of up to 4th level it used in the
previous round. It otherwise functions as a lesser
rod of dragon's blood.
Aura/Caster Level: Strong transmutation; CL 17th.

ROD OF THE DRAGON HEART
Dragon lords (see page 38) and other war leaders hold these
rods aloft in battle, letting a wave of fear wash over their foes,
much as if a dragon were present.
Description: A rod of the dragon heart is an iron shaft about
1 foot long with a small cage at the top. Within the cage is a
purple crystal shaped like a dragon's heart. When its bearer is
engaged in battle, fleeting apparitions of tiny dragons appear
in the air above the rod of the dragon heart. The apparitions
are clearly not real, and each remains for just a second or two
before vanishing. But for opponents of the rod's bearer, the
brief images have an unsettling, sinister quality.
Activation: To activate a rod of the dragon heart, the wielder's
current hit points must equal or exceed half his full normal
hit points. He must hold the rod in one hand and utter the
command word (a standard action), which is often an ancient
dragon's name, such as "Paelchronithrax" or "Tueranachtrus."
The rod is active for a maximum of 10 rounds per day, split
up however the wielder likes. He can turn off the rod with
a mental command (a free action).
While the rod is active, if the wielder's current hit points
fall below half his full normal hit points, the rod immediately
turns off.
Effect: Enemies within 30 feet of the wielder when he
activates the rod (or who come within 30 feet of an already
active rod) must attempt DC 16 Will saves. Foes who fail their
saves are shaken as long as they remain within 120 feet of the
rod. Foes who make their saves are immune to the effects of
the rod of the dragon heart for 24 hours. Creatures immune to a
dragon's frightful presence are immune to the rod's effect.
Aura/Caster Level: Moderate necromancy; CL 7th.
Construction: Craft Rod, fear, 4000 gp, 160 XP, 8 days.

SHIELD OF THE WINGED CRUSADE
Devised by notable members of the swift wing prestige class
(see page 50), a shield of the winged crusade provides protection
in melee combat and against area attacks such as a dragon's
breath weapon.
Description: Shields of the winged crusade are heavy shields
of dull red metal. Their design has a scaly appearance. A split
second before a shield's translocation effect activates, it emits
a harsh buzzing sound, which fades a second or two after the
translocation is complete.
Activation: The shield's +1 enhancement bonus to Armor
Class is always active. Once per day, the wearer can use its
translocation effect as an immediate action.
Effect: A shield of the winged crusade is a +1 heavy steel shield
that can save its wearer from an area attack. A wearer who
is within the area of an instantaneous-duration effect that
allows a Reflex save to reduce its effect (such as a fireball spell
or a breath weapon) can activate the shield's translocation
effect. By doing so, he instantaneously moves 10 feet in any
direction of his chosing. If the movement takes him beyond
the boundary of the area attack, he doesn't need to attempt
the Reflex save.
Aura/Caster Level: Moderate abjuration; CL 8th.
Construction: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, dimension
door, 1,670 gp, 120 XP, 3 days.

SWORD OF THE GREAT HARROWING
When bathed in the blood of dragons, no sword is deadlier
against a draconic foe than a sword of the great harrowing. A
longsword imbued with sentience and a seething hatred
for all dragons, the blade and its bearer seek out dragons to
behead-but the sword is ever watchful for a more powerful
wielder.
Lore: These swords, created by the Harrowers (see page
143), are more powerful versions of dragonbane swords
(DC 15 Knowledge [arcana]). Seven swords of the great harrowing
are known to exist, and all are fully sentient. However, not
all are still in the hands of the Harrowers (DC 25 Knowledge
[arcana]).
Description: A sword of the great harrowing is a wide-bladed
longsword with a fang-decorated crossguard and a ruby inset
in the pommel.
The sword glows like many magic weapons, but its true
power becomes apparent once it activates its dragonblood
consumption power (described below). Then the sword
turns bright red, and a whirling cascade of crimson energy
surrounds the sword, the wielder, and the dragon they are
fighting.
Personality: Originally created by the Harrowers, the
swords of the great harrowing are in many ways similar to the
dragons they hate: single-minded, ruthless, and endlessly
patient. A sword of the great harrowing knows it needs a strong
hand to wield it, though, so it acts as friend and confidant to
its bearer, offering counsel and support when asked.
Only two occurrences can put such a sword at odds with
its wielder. First, if the wielder refuses to face a dragon in
combat, the sword of the great harrowing immediately attempts
to take control of him. Second, if the sword becomes aware
of a more powerful potential owner, it silently observes for a
time, and then tries to subtly engineer a conflict between its
current owner and what it hopes will be its future master.
These swords speak Common, Elven, Dwarven, and
Draconic.
AL N; Int 10, Wis 17, Cha 17; speech and telepathy; 120 ft.
darkvision and hearing; Ego score 17.
Activation: Because it's an intelligent weapon, a sword of
the great harrowing takes actions of its own during its wielder's
turn. Its actions are generally limited to activating one of its
three powers.

96
Effect: A sword of the great harrowing is a +1 dragonbane
longsword with two lesser powers that it is eager to use on
behalf of its master. Three times per day each, it can use resist
energy (20 points, sword's choice of energy type) and remove
fear.
But in battle with a wounded dragon, a sword of the great
harrowing becomes something much more. Immediately
after the wielder successfully deals damage to a dragon with
the sword, it activates its dragonblood consumption power.
At the end of each of the wielder's turns, check whether the
sword dealt damage to the dragon that round. If it did, its
enhancement bonus increases by 1 for future attacks against
that dragon. If it did not, its enhancement bonus decreases by
1 for future attacks against that dragon. One hour after the
last time the sword deals damage to a dragon, this effect fades,
and the sword's enhancement bonus returns to normal.
A sword of the great harrowing's enhancement bonus can't
drop below +1 (or the normal enhancement bonus of the
sword, if improved beyond +1), nor can it rise above the
dragon's age category (including the benefit of the bane
quality). For dragons without an age category, treat the age
category as 1/4 the dragon's Hit Dice (maximum age category
of 10 for a dragon with 40 or more Hit Dice).
Variants: As written, a sword of the great harrowing is
neutral, an implacable foe of both chromatic and metallic
dragons. But the DM can change its alignment and narrow its
focus to produce a variant sword that hates only evil dragons
(or only good ones).
It's also possible to change the sword into another type of
weapon. Simply subtract 15 gp from the cost, and add the
cost of the new weapon. Aura/Caster Level: Strong transmutation; CL 15th.

TAILBANDS OF IMPACT	TYPE:Footwear.Boot
	SPROP:An attack with a tail equipped with tailbands of impact is considered adamantine and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, tailbands of impact allow the wearer to apply more of his Strength bonus on damage rolls for tail slap attacks. Consult the table below to determine the effect. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate evocation; CL 11th.

TOME OF THE WYRM
Favored by spellcasters who hunt dragons, a tome of the wyrm
gradually increases the potency of its bearer's spells.
Lore: A tome of the wyrm describes dozens of battles
between spellcasters and dragons (DC 10 Knowledge
[arcana]). Wyrm wizards (see page 55) created the tomes to help
them conduct research by overcoming the magical defenses
of dragons, growing stronger over time (DC 20 Knowledge
[arcana]).
Description: A tome of the wyrm is a leather-covered grimoire
with binding hinges and a back plate made of dark
iron. An embossed, glowing eye with a slitted pupil adorns
the cover. The eye remains heavily lidded unless a dragon
attacks the tome's owner or the owner attempts a saving
throw against a dragon's frightful presence. Then it opens
wide until the battle is over.
Prerequisite: Anyone can carry a tome of the wyrm, but its
magic benefits only those who cast spells.
Activation: A tome of the wyrm functions automatically,
but only when carried in one hand. If it is left in a backpack
or other container, it still records battles (as described below),
but it doesn't improve its owner's caster level.
Effect: A spellcaster carrying a tome of the wyrm in one
hand gains a +1 insight bonus to his caster level on any spell
that targets an enemy dragon or includes an enemy dragon
in its area. This benefit applies against all creatures affected
by the spell, not just the dragon.
At the end of each of the caster's turns, determine whether
he cast a spell that harmed an enemy dragon. (For the purpose
of this item, this means any spell that dealt damage to the
dragon, any spell against which the dragon failed a save, or
any spell that overcame the dragon's spell resistance.) If so,
the insight bonus of the tome of the wyrm increases by 1. If
not, the insight bonus decreases by 1.
A tome of the wyrm's bonus can't drop below +1, nor can it
rise above a number equal to the highest-level spell that its
owner can cast. One hour after the last time the caster harms
an enemy dragon with a spell, this effect fades, and the tome's
bonus returns to normal.
Each page of a tome of the wyrm describes one battle against
a dragon-a brief narrative explaining who was present,
how the fight unfolded, and how the dragon died (or how
its attackers got away). After each new battle with a dragon,
the tome magically adds a new page describing that battle.
Once this 200-page book is full, any new entry overwrites
the oldest entry.

VIAL OF EXPLOSIVE BREATH
A lesser vial of explosive breath holds a tightly controlled quantity
of energy not unlike a dragon's breath weapon. Prized by
dragons and their allies alike, this item offers a surprise for
those who think they know what to expect from a foe.
Description: This smoky crystal vial is closed with a
golden stopper, capped by a faintly glowing piece of clear
quartz. When it shatters, destructive magical energy explodes
outward, looking very much like a dragon unfolding its wings
before dissipating into thin air.
Activation: A creature can throw a lesser vial of explosive
breath as an attack, either as a standard action or as part of a
full attack action. Hurling the vial as a ranged attack provokes
attacks of opportunity.
Effect: A lesser vial of explosive breath is hurled as a splash
weapon and must be aimed at a grid intersection. Upon
impact, the vial shatters, releasing the energy of its breath
weapon in a 20-foot-radius spread centered upon the point
of impact. This deals 6d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or
fire damage, depending on the breath weapon of the dragon
that created the vial (Reflex DC 18 half).
Variant: A greater version of this item can be crafted by
true dragons of ancient age or older. A greater vial of explosive
breath deals 10d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half).
Aura/Caster Level: Moderate transmutation; CL 6th.
Construction: Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be a
true dragon of adult age or greater with a breath weapon that
deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, 500 gp (or 1000
gp for greater vial), 40 XP (or 80 XP for greater vial), 1 day (or
2 days for greater vial).
