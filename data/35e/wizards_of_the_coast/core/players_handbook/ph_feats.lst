Blind-Fight				TYPE:General.Fighter.AttackOption																																																																								DESC:You know how to fight in melee without being able to see your foes.	BENEFIT:In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit (see Concealment, page 152). An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible (see Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151). The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half (see Table 9-4: Hampered Movement, page 163). Normal: Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you (see Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers, page 151) apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility (see Table 9-4: Hampered Movement, page 163) also applies. Special: The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell (see page 206).

See the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on potions.	BENEFIT:You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level ? its caster level ? 50 gp. to brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price. When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell. Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.

Combat Reflexes			TYPE:General.Fighter.AttackOption																																																																								DESC:You can respond quickly and repeatedly to opponents who let their defenses down.	BENEFIT:When foes leave themselves open, you may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus. For example, a fighter with a Dexterity of 15 can make a total of three attacks of opportunity in 1 round-the one attack of opportunity any character is entitled to, plus two more because of his +2 Dexterity bonus. If four goblins move out of the character's threatened squares, he can make one attack of opportunity each against three of the four. You can still make only one attack of opportunity per opportunity. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed. Normal: A character without this feat can make only one attack of opportunity per round and can't make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed. Special: The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability (see page 51) more than once per round.

The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost. You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.

BENEFIT:You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know. Crafting a wand takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a wand is its caster level ? the spell level ? 750 gp. to craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.

You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn't your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious. When using this feat, you can take either a single move or standard action each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a full-round action. You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other action the DM deems as strenuous, including some free actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act.
